Write a function that takes a list of numbers and returns a list with two elements:
1. The first element should be the sum of all even numbers in the list.
2. The second element should be the sum of all odd numbers in the list.

Note:
Count 0 as an even number!

Examples:
1 2 3 4 5 6 ➞ [12, 9]
# 2 + 4 + 6 = 12 and 1 + 3 + 5 = 9

-1 -2 -3 -4 -5 -6 ➞ [-12, -9]

0 0 ➞ [0, 0]
